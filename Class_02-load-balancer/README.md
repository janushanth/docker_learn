# Class 02: Load Balancer

This folder contains a setup for a load-balanced environment with multiple Flask services (`jaffnakid` and `wellawattakid`) behind an Nginx reverse proxy using Docker Compose.

## Description

### `docker-compose.yml`
This is the main configuration file to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It defines the services for Jaffnakid, Wellawattakid, and an Nginx load balancer that balances traffic between the two services.

### `nginx.conf`
This file contains the Nginx configuration for load balancing between the Jaffnakid and Wellawattakid services.

### `jaffnakid/`
This folder contains the Python application code, the required dependencies (`requirements.txt`), and the `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image for the Jaffnakid service.

### `wellawattakid/`
This folder contains the Python application code, the required dependencies (`requirements.txt`), and the `Dockerfile` to build the Docker image for the Wellawattakid service.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janushanth/docker_learn.git
   cd docker_learn/Class_02-load-balancer
   ```

2. Build and start the Docker containers using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the application via the Nginx load balancer at `http://localhost:8088`.
